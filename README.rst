Juris-M Word for Windows Integration
====================================

This repository contains code for repackaging a compiled release of
the Zotero Word for Windows Integration plugin for use with the
Juris-M referencing platform. The plugin provides a chooser to prevent
both the Juris-M and Zotero versions from being installed
simultaneously.

The original source code of the Zotero plugin (with Affero GPL license)
is here::
